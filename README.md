# Bash scripts

These are my bash scripts,
that I use on my daily shell interactions. <br/>
for example  i use extract.sh for extract (rar zip 7z) files just give address of file and maybe password of rar file then you have unrar file <br/>

extract.sh : extract format ( rar zip 7z ) <br/>
weather.sh : show the weather in your terminal <br/>
trans : terminal google translate <br/>
speedtest_cli.py : show speed of your internet connection <br/>
mp4-to-mp3 : convert mp4 file to mp3 <br/>
mpv-xclip : play url in clipboard with mpv player <br/>

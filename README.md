# Bash scripts

These are my bash scripts,
that I use on my daily shell interactions.
for example  i use extract.sh for extract (rar zip 7z) files just give address of file and maybe password of rar file then you have unrar file

extract.sh : extract format ( rar zip 7z )
weather.sh : show the weather in your terminal
trans : terminal google translate
speedtest_cli.py : show speed of your internet connection
mp4-to-mp3 : convert mp4 file to mp3
mpv-xclip : play url in clipboard with mpv player
